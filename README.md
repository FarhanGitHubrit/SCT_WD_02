STOPWATCH WEB APPLICATION
I recently developed a fully functional Stopwatch Web Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance my front-end development skills and gain hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Start, Pause, and Reset the timer with ease


Track and display lap times accurately


Real-time time updates with millisecond precision


Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface


DOM manipulation and event-driven programming


Seamless keyboard input handling for better accessibility


ðŸ’¡ This project allowed me to dive deep into DOM manipulation, event listeners, and interval-based time calculations, while focusing on intuitive UI design and dynamic updates.
